# CS210


This project was made to showcase my knowledge to read text files and my overall knowledge of the course thus far!

The Objectives:
  - Search for a specific item
  - Display the frequency of all items
  - Display frequency distribution
  - Read the inventory.txt file

In particular, I was able to to complete the project with a bit of effort. I got caught up in the "try" and "catch" commands. I struggle with the concept of try and catch commands. I had to use outside sources such as "YouTube" and Google to help me out. I plan on studying and practicing try and catch commands until I understand the concept. The skills that will transfer the most will be my ability to problem solve and my growth mindset. I failed a lot with this project, but that didn't stop me from trying and staying positive! To make the program maintainable, eliminating my redundant code with the try and catch commands was the way to go.
